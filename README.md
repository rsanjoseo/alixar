# Alixar ERP & CRM, a complete refactoring of Dolibarr

### VERY IMPORTANT: Do not use Alixar in production, because the refactoring process is in progress and will take us some time.

Alixar is a complete refactoring of the Dolibarr package (https://github.com/dolibarr/dolibarr).

You can find additional information at https://alxarafe.com

Dolibarr ERP & CRM is a complete business management application that helps manage the activity of your organization (
contacts, suppliers, invoices, orders, stocks, agenda...).

It is an open source software package (written in PHP with optional JavaScript enhancements) designed to small, medium
or large companies, foundations and freelancers.

You can use it, study it, modify it or distribute it freely according to your license.

You can use it as a standalone application or as a web application to access it from the Internet or a LAN.

Dolibarr has a powerful and active community, but the technology on which it is based is totally outdated.

### Alixar

Alixar intends to make modifications to the code for its improvement, but these changes will make it incompatible with
the original.
